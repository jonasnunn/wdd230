            <p>Nike has done a good job of making sure there is plenty of white space so the design dosen't feel cramped. 
               This white space allows the user to easily identify the different areas of the shop. It gives a nice feeling
               to the website and a professional look.</p>

            <p>NFL Shop did great at following Hick's law and keeping the deisgn simple. There are 32 nfl teams but at the top of the page they only show to ones in the playoffs, becuase those are much more likely to be the teams fans are looking for.
               This makes it easy to find what you want and avoids giving the user too many options.</p>

            <p>Google knows what people want to see when they go to google shop and they present it immdiattly.
               They do a really good job of having a nice visual hierarchy. Their is a natural progression to the page that makes it feel easy to scroll down.</p>
